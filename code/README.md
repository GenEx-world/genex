## Introduction

GenEx is a two-stage pipeline designed to create and navigate immersive virtual environments:

1. **World Initialization**: Transform a single perspective image into a complete 360¬∞ panoramic environment
2. **World Exploration**: Enable dynamic navigation through the generated panoramic world

Together, these components allow for the creation and exploration of fully realized virtual worlds from minimal input.

## Components

### GenEx World Initializer

The World Initializer converts a single-view image into a complete 360¬∞ panorama using vision-conditioned inpainting.

Key features:
- Input: One perspective image (any size, center-cropped to square)
- Optional text prompts to guide panorama generation
- Output: 2048 √ó 1024 equirectangular image

### GenEx World Explorer

The World Explorer enables dynamic navigation through panoramic environments using video generation techniques built on Stable Video Diffusion.

Key features:
- Generate smooth forward movements through scenes
- Rotate panoramic images programmatically
- Convert between different panoramic representations
- Extract normal rectilinear views from panoramas
- Save explorations as videos or GIFs

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- **/inference/**: Code for running inference with pre-trained models (single GPU)
- **/data/**: Collection tools and datasets for training GenEx
- **/evaluate/**: Scripts for evaluating model performance using various metrics
- **/train/**: Scripts for training both World Initializer and Explorer components
- **/demo/**: Demo applications and examples showcasing GenEx capabilities (8 GPU server)
